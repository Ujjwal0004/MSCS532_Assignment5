# MSCS532_Assignment5

To run the code:

Make sure Python is already installed in the system. If not, install Python before running the code

Clone the GitHub Repository using git clone https://github.com/Ujjwal0004/MSCS532_Assignment5.git

Run the code using the command: 

python .\Quick Sort.py

Summary:

In this assignment, the quicksort algorithm is used to determine the implementation and performance of deterministic and randomized quicksort and compare them. From this assignment, the findings that were observed were that randomized quicksort provides better efficiency and performance compared to deterministic quicksort. The conclusion was made using the theoretical analysis and experimental analysis, where the code was run with different input sizes and distributions to find the running time of deterministic and randomized quicksort under various situations.
